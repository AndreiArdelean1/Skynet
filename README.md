# Skynet Firewall

This is my current Skynet filter list running on Asus-Merlin firmware for Asus routers. For more information on Skynet, see the description below. Keep in mind, that this setup may change depending on how much inconvenience it brings to the household members. ðŸ˜„

Skynet is the first comprehensive IP banning and security tool built exclusively for Asus devices. It significantly enhances the built-in security features of Asus-Merlin firmware, such as the SPI Firewall, Brute Force Detection, and AiProtect, while providing users with easy-to-use tools for customizing firewall rules.

### Key Features of Skynet:
- **IP and Domain Blocking**: Ban individual IPs, entire domains, or even entire countries.
- **Predefined Malware Lists**: Pulls from reputable malware lists to enhance security.
- **IoT Device Security**: Prevents IoT devices from making unwanted connections or "phoning home."
- **Custom Firewall Rules**: Allows advanced users to implement specific security rules tailored to their needs.

Skynet is a powerful all-in-one solution for securing your router and is the first line of defense for your home network.
